1.0,Numbers,Basic Mathematical Concepts,easy,What is the sum of the place value and the face value of the digit 7 in the number 9753?,no image,"{""1"":""707"",""2"":""700"",""3"":""693"",""4"":""70""}",1.0,"The correct option is 1.

In the number 9753, the digit 7 is in the hundreds place. The place value of a digit is its value based on its position in the number. Therefore, the place value of 7 is 7 × 100 = 700. The face value of a digit is the digit itself, which is 7. The question asks for the sum of the place value and the face value, which is 700 + 7 = 707.

Option 2 is incorrect because 700 is only the place value of the digit 7, not the sum. Option 3 is incorrect because 693 is the difference between the place value and the face value (700 - 7), not the sum. Option 4 is incorrect because 70 would be the place value if the digit 7 were in the tens place, which it is not.",
2.0,Numbers,Basic Mathematical Concepts,medium,"Two values, A and B, are defined by the expressions shown in the image. What is the result of the operation A - B?",Basic Mathematical Concepts_1766389746746.png,"{""1"":""105"",""2"":""120"",""3"":""45"",""4"":""144""}",1.0,"The correct option is 1.

First, let's calculate the value of A. A is defined as the sum of all prime numbers between 20 and 40. The prime numbers in this range are 23, 29, 31, and 37. Summing these numbers gives: A = 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 = 120.

Next, we calculate the value of B. B is defined as the sum of all odd composite numbers between 10 and 20. The odd numbers in this range are 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. Among these, 11, 13, 17, and 19 are prime. The only odd composite number is 15 (since 15 = 3 × 5). Therefore, B = 15.

Finally, we perform the subtraction A - B. This gives 120 - 15 = 105.

Option 2 is incorrect. This value of 120 would be the result if B were 0, which would happen if one mistakenly thought there were no odd composite numbers between 10 and 20.

Option 3 is incorrect. This value of 45 is obtained if B is wrongly calculated as the sum of all odd numbers in the range (11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 75), leading to an incorrect calculation of 120 - 75 = 45.

Option 4 is incorrect. This value of 144 could be reached if A is miscalculated by including a composite number like 39 (A = 120 + 39 = 159), and then B is subtracted (159 - 15 = 144).",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Basic_Mathematical_Concepts_1766389746746.png?
3.0,Numbers,Basic Mathematical Concepts,hard,"A three-digit number is defined as 'balanced' if it satisfies the condition shown in the image, where 'a' is the hundreds digit, 'b' is the tens digit, and 'c' is the units digit. The digits are not necessarily distinct. What is the sum of all such balanced three-digit numbers?",Basic Mathematical Concepts_1766389823207.png,"{""1"":""24855"",""2"":""22755"",""3"":""19860"",""4"":""29850""}",1.0,"Option 1 is correct. The condition for a three-digit number '100a + 10b + c' to be balanced is given by the equation, which simplifies to 2b = a + c. Here, 'a' must be in {1, 2, ..., 9} and 'b', 'c' must be in {0, 1, ..., 9}. We need to find the sum of all such numbers.

A systematic approach is to categorize the numbers and sum them up. We can use a pairing insight. For any balanced number N = 100a + 10b + c where c is not 0, the number N' = 100c + 10b + a is also a balanced number, since a+c = c+a. The sum of such a pair is N + N' = 101(a+c) + 20b. Substituting a+c = 2b, the sum becomes 101(2b) + 20b = 202b + 20b = 222b.

We can break the problem into three cases:
Case 1: Palindromic numbers (a = c). The condition 2b = a + c becomes 2b = 2a, so b = a. The numbers are 111, 222, ..., 999. Their sum is 111 * (1 + 2 + ... + 9) = 111 * 45 = 4995.

Case 2: Numbers ending in zero (c = 0). The condition becomes 2b = a. Since 'a' must be a non-zero digit, possible (a,b) pairs are (2,1), (4,2), (6,3), (8,4). This gives the numbers 210, 420, 630, 840. Their sum is 210 + 420 + 630 + 840 = 2100.

Case 3: Asymmetric numbers where a ? c and c ? 0. We count the pairs (N, N') where a < c to avoid double counting. The sum for each pair is 222b. We count the number of pairs for each value of b:
- b=2 (a+c=4): 1 pair (123, 321). Sum = 1 * 222 * 2 = 444.
- b=3 (a+c=6): 2 pairs (135, 531; 234, 432). Sum = 2 * 222 * 3 = 1332.
- b=4 (a+c=8): 3 pairs. Sum = 3 * 222 * 4 = 2664.
- b=5 (a+c=10): 4 pairs. Sum = 4 * 222 * 5 = 4440.
- b=6 (a+c=12): 3 pairs. Sum = 3 * 222 * 6 = 3996.
- b=7 (a+c=14): 2 pairs. Sum = 2 * 222 * 7 = 3108.
- b=8 (a+c=16): 1 pair. Sum = 1 * 222 * 8 = 1776.
The total sum for this case is 444 + 1332 + 2664 + 4440 + 3996 + 3108 + 1776 = 17760.

The total sum of all balanced numbers is the sum from all three cases: 4995 (palindromes) + 2100 (ending in 0) + 17760 (asymmetric pairs) = 24855.

Option 2 (22755) is incorrect. This is the result of 24855 - 2100, which happens if one forgets to include the numbers ending in zero (Case 2).

Option 3 (19860) is incorrect. This is the result of 24855 - 4995, which happens if one forgets to include the palindromic numbers (Case 1).

Option 4 (29850) is incorrect. This is the result of 24855 + 4995. This error could occur if one calculates the total sum correctly and then adds the sum of palindromes a second time, possibly due to a miscounting methodology.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Basic_Mathematical_Concepts_1766389823207.png?

The divisibility rule for 9 states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. For the number 7*31, the sum of the known digits is 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. To make the number divisible by 9, the total sum (11 + *) must be a multiple of 9. The smallest multiple of 9 greater than 11 is 18. So, 11 + * = 18, which gives * = 7.

5.0,Numbers,Divisibility Rules,medium,"A 10-digit number contains two unknown digits, x and y.

To be divisible by 88, the number must be divisible by its co-prime factors, which are 8 and 11.

First, we apply the divisibility rule for 8. A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8. In this case, the last three digits are '8y2'. For '8y2' to be divisible by 8, we can test values for y from 0 to 9. The number 800 is divisible by 8, so we only need to check if 'y2' is divisible by 8. Testing values, we find that 32 (for y=3) and 72 (for y=7) are divisible by 8. Thus, the possible values for y are 3 and 7.

Next, we apply the divisibility rule for 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and the sum of the digits at even positions is 0 or a multiple of 11. The number is 1330x558y2. The sum of digits at odd positions is 1+3+x+5+y = 9+x+y. The sum of digits at even positions is 3+0+5+8+2 = 18. The difference is |(9+x+y) - 18| = |x+y-9|. This difference must be 0 or a multiple of 11.

We now combine these findings with a case analysis. Case 1: If y = 3, the difference is |x+3-9| = |x-6|. For this to be 0 or 11, x must be 6 (since x is a single digit). In this case, x+y = 6+3 = 9. Case 2: If y = 7, the difference is |x+7-9| = |x-2|. For this to be 0 or 11, x must be 2 (since x is a single digit). In this case, x+y = 2+7 = 9. In both valid scenarios, the value of x+y is 9.

Option 2 (13) would result from incorrectly pairing x=6 with y=7. Option 3 (5) would result from incorrectly pairing x=2 with y=3. Option 4 (8) could arise from a calculation error in the divisibility rule for 11, such as solving |x+y-9| = 1 instead of 0.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Divisibility_Rules_1766389918186.png?
6.0,Numbers,Divisibility Rules,hard,"A seven-digit number N is represented as 8A09B1C. This number is known to be perfectly divisible by 792. If A, B, and C are single-digit integers, what is the value of the expression shown in the image?",Divisibility Rules_1766389989380.png,"{""1"":""6"",""2"":""14"",""3"":""10"",""4"":""2""}",1.0,"The correct option is 1.

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 792. 792 = 8 × 99 = 8 × 9 × 11. For the number N = 8A09B1C to be divisible by 792, it must be divisible by the co-prime factors 8, 9, and 11.

1. Divisibility by 8: The number formed by the last three digits, B1C, must be divisible by 8. We can write B1C as 100B + 16. A simpler method is to check values. The number '1C' when B is even must be divisible by 8 (e.g., 01C, 21C, etc.), and when B is odd (e.g., 11C, 31C, etc.). Testing shows if B is even, 16 is divisible by 8, so C must be 6 for B1C to be divisible by 8 (e.g., 216, 416). If B is odd, 12 is divisible by 8, so C must be 2 (e.g., 112, 312). Thus, we have two conditions: (i) If B is even, C=6. (ii) If B is odd, C=2.

2. Divisibility by 9: The sum of the digits of N must be divisible by 9. Sum = 8+A+0+9+B+1+C = 18 + A+B+C. Since 18 is divisible by 9, the sum A+B+C must be a multiple of 9.

3. Divisibility by 11: The difference between the sum of digits at odd places and the sum of digits at even places must be a multiple of 11. Odd places: 8, 0, B, C. Sum = 8+B+C. Even places: A, 9, 1. Sum = A+10. Difference = (8+B+C) - (A+10) = B+C-A-2. So, B+C-A-2 must be a multiple of 11.

We now solve using two cases based on the rule for 8.

Case 1: B is odd, so C = 2. 
From the rule for 11: B+2-A-2 = B-A must be a multiple of 11. Since A and B are single digits, the only possibility is B-A = 0, which means A=B. 
From the rule for 9: A+B+C = A+A+2 = 2A+2 must be a multiple of 9. So, 2(A+1) must be a multiple of 9. This implies A+1 is a multiple of 9. As A is a single digit, A+1 can only be 9, which means A=8. If A=8, then B=8. This contradicts our initial assumption that B is odd. So, this case is not possible.

Case 2: B is even, so C = 6.
From the rule for 11: B+6-A-2 = B-A+4 must be a multiple of 11. Since B is an even digit {0,2,4,6,8} and A is a digit {0-9}, the value of B-A+4 ranges from (0-9)+4 = -5 to (8-0)+4 = 12. The only multiples of 11 in this range are 0 and 11. 
Subcase 2a: B-A+4 = 0 => A = B+4. Now we use the rule for 9: A+B+C = (B+4)+B+6 = 2B+10 must be a multiple of 9. We test the even values for B: If B=0, 2(0)+10=10 (No). If B=2, 2(2)+10=14 (No). If B=4, 2(4)+10=18 (Yes). If B=4, then A=4+4=8. This is a valid solution. A=8, B=4, C=6. 
Subcase 2b: B-A+4 = 11 => A = B-7. Since A must be non-negative, B must be at least 7. The only even possibility is B=8. If B=8, A=1. Now we use the rule for 9: A+B+C = 1+8+6 = 15, which is not a multiple of 9. This subcase yields no solution.

The only valid solution is A=8, B=4, C=6. The expression is A+B-C = 8+4-6 = 6.

Option 2 (14) is obtained if one incorrectly proceeds with Case 1 (ignoring the contradiction) to get A=8, B=8, C=2. Then A+B-C = 8+8-2 = 14. This is incorrect as N=8809812 is not divisible by 8. Option 3 (10) and Option 4 (2) result from incorrect calculations with the correct A, B, C values (e.g., A-B+C = 8-4+6=10 and -A+B+C = -8+4+6=2).",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Divisibility_Rules_1766389989380.png?

To find the unit digit of the product of several numbers, we only need to multiply their unit digits. The unit digits in the expression are 3 (from 123), 6 (from 456), and 9 (from 789). First, we find the unit digit of the product of the first two unit digits: 3 × 6 = 18. The unit digit of this result is 8. Then, we multiply this new unit digit (8) by the unit digit of the next number (9): 8 × 9 = 72. The unit digit of 72 is 2. Therefore, the unit digit of the entire expression is 2.

Option 1 is incorrect because 8 is the unit digit of the product of only the first two numbers (123 × 456), but it neglects the third number.

Option 3 is incorrect because 4 is the unit digit from multiplying the last two unit digits (6 × 9 = 54), which incorrectly ignores the first number's unit digit.

To find the unit digit of the expression, we must find the unit digit of each term and then perform the operations. First, consider the term (137)^43. The unit digit is determined by the unit digit of 7^43. The pattern of unit digits for powers of 7 is 7, 9, 3, 1, which repeats every 4 powers. To find the position in this cycle, we find the remainder of 43 divided by 4, which is 3. The third unit digit in the cycle is 3. Second, consider the term (264)^58. The unit digit is determined by 4^58. The pattern of unit digits for powers of 4 is 4, 6, which repeats every 2 powers. Since the exponent 58 is even, the unit digit is 6. Third, consider the term (345)^76. Any positive integer power of a number ending in 5 will have a unit digit of 5. Now, we combine the unit digits: (unit digit of the first term) + (unit digit of the second term) - (unit digit of the third term). This corresponds to 3 + 6 - 5. The sum 3 + 6 is 9. Then, 9 - 5 gives 4. Therefore, the unit digit of the entire expression is 4.

Option 2 is incorrect. An answer of 8 would be reached if the unit digit for (137)^43 was mistakenly taken as 7 (corresponding to a remainder of 1 when dividing 43 by 4), leading to 7 + 6 - 5 = 8. Option 3 is incorrect. An answer of 2 would be reached if the unit digit of (264)^58 was incorrectly assumed to be 4 (confusing the rule for even and odd powers), leading to 3 + 4 - 5 = 2.

Term 1: (137)^(41!)
The unit digit is determined by 7^(41!). The cyclicity of the unit digits of powers of 7 is 4 (7, 9, 3, 1). We need to find the remainder of the exponent 41! when divided by 4. Since 41 is greater than or equal to 4, 41! contains 4 as a factor, which means 41! is perfectly divisible by 4. The remainder is 0. When the remainder is 0, we take the 4th term in the cycle, which is 1. So, the unit digit of (137)^(41!) is 1.

Term 2: (248)^(97^35)
The unit digit is determined by 8^(97^35). The cyclicity of the unit digits of powers of 8 is 4 (8, 4, 2, 6). We need to find the remainder of the exponent 97^35 when divided by 4. First, find the remainder of the base of the exponent, 97, when divided by 4. 97 = (24 * 4) + 1, so 97 leaves a remainder of 1. Therefore, 97^35 will have the same remainder as 1^35 when divided by 4, which is 1. The exponent is of the form 4k + 1. We take the 1st term in the cycle of 8, which is 8. So, the unit digit of (248)^(97^35) is 8.

Term 3: (359)^(123! + 1)
The unit digit is determined by 9^(123! + 1). The cyclicity of the unit digits of powers of 9 is 2 (9 for odd powers, 1 for even powers). We need to determine if the exponent 123! + 1 is odd or even. Since 123 is greater than 1, 123! is a product of many integers including 2, so it is an even number. Adding 1 to an even number (123!) results in an odd number. Thus, the exponent is odd. For an odd exponent, the unit digit of a power of 9 is 9. So, the unit digit of (359)^(123! + 1) is 9.

Finally, we add the unit digits of the three terms: 1 + 8 + 9 = 18. The unit digit of the sum is the unit digit of 18, which is 8.

Option 1 is incorrect. A unit digit of 6 would be obtained if the second term's unit digit was incorrectly calculated as 6 (by assuming the exponent is a multiple of 4), leading to 1 + 6 + 9 = 16.
Option 2 is incorrect. A unit digit of 2 would be obtained if the second term's unit digit was incorrectly calculated as 2 (by assuming the exponent gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 4), leading to 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.
Option 4 is incorrect. A unit digit of 0 would be obtained if the third term's unit digit was incorrectly calculated as 1 (by assuming the exponent is even), leading to 1 + 8 + 1 = 10.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Unit_Digits_1766390095652.png?

To find the remainder when 125 is divided by 8, we can use the division algorithm which states that Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder. The largest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 125 is 8 × 15 = 120. Subtracting this from 125 gives 125 - 120 = 5. So, 125 = (8 × 15) + 5. The remainder is 5.

According to the remainder theorem, we can express the given information as two equations.
From the first condition: N = D * q1 + 46, where q1 is the quotient. This implies that the divisor D must be greater than the remainder, so D > 46.
From the second condition: 2N = D * q2 + 37, where q2 is the quotient. This implies D > 37. Combining both conditions gives D > 46.

Now, substitute the expression for N from the first equation into the second equation:
2 * (D * q1 + 46) = D * q2 + 37
2*D*q1 + 92 = D*q2 + 37
Rearranging the terms to isolate the constants: 92 - 37 = D*q2 - 2*D*q1
55 = D * (q2 - 2*q1)

This equation shows that 55 is a multiple of D, which means D must be a factor of 55. The factors of 55 are 1, 5, 11, and 55. Based on our earlier condition that D > 46, the only possible value for the divisor D is 55.

Option 2, 65, is incorrect. It may arise from a calculation error, for instance, 92 - 37 = 65. If D were a factor of 65 and greater than 46, D would be 65, but this is based on an incorrect subtraction.

Therefore, the remainder of P(x) divided by (x - 3)^2 is the same as the remainder of (ax^2 + bx + c) divided by (x - 3)^2. Let's perform this division. The divisor is (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9. We can write ax^2 + bx + c = a(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (b + 6a)x + (c - 9a). The remainder is (b + 6a)x + (c - 9a). We are given that this remainder is x + 2. By comparing the coefficients of x and the constant terms, we get two more equations: b + 6a = 1 (Eq. 2) and c - 9a = 2 (Eq. 3).

Now we solve the system of three linear equations. From (Eq. 2), b = 1 - 6a. From (Eq. 3), c = 2 + 9a. Substituting these into (Eq. 1): a + (1 - 6a) + (2 + 9a) = 1. Simplifying, we get 4a + 3 = 1, which gives 4a = -2, so a = -1/2. Now we find b and c: b = 1 - 6(-1/2) = 1 + 3 = 4. c = 2 + 9(-1/2) = 2 - 9/2 = -5/2. The remainder polynomial is R(x) = (-1/2)x^2 + 4x - 5/2.

The question asks for the value of R(7). R(7) = (-1/2)(7)^2 + 4(7) - 5/2 = -49/2 + 28 - 5/2 = -54/2 + 28 = -27 + 28 = 1.

Option 2 is incorrect. It would be the result of R(7) if one mistakenly swapped the given remainders, leading to R(x) = (1/2)x^2 + 5/2. Option 3 is incorrect. It is the result of wrongly assuming the remainder is linear, R(x) = 2x - 1, which gives R(7)=13. This is a flawed assumption as the divisor is cubic. Option 4 is incorrect. It arises from a calculation error, such as setting b+6a=2 instead of b+6a=1, leading to a different R(x) and R(7)=4.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Remainder_Theorem_1766390216246.png?

Their HCF is H and their LCM is L. We are given A = 2H and B = 3H. Since H is the HCF of all three numbers, C must also be a multiple of H. Let C = kH for some natural number k.

The three numbers are 2H, 3H, and kH. The HCF of these numbers is H * HCF(2, 3, k). Since we are given that the HCF is H, it implies that HCF(2, 3, k) = 1. This condition holds true for any integer k, as HCF(2, 3) is already 1.

The LCM of these numbers is L = H * LCM(2, 3, k) = H * LCM(6, k).

We are given the product H * L = 3024. Substituting the expression for L, we get:
H * [H * LCM(6, k)] = 3024
H² * LCM(6, k) = 3024

First, we find the prime factorization of 3024: 3024 = 24 * 3³ * 7.
Since H² is a factor of 3024, H² must be a perfect square that divides 3024. The perfect square factors of 3024 are 1, 4, 9, 36, and 144. We test each possible value of H to find the smallest possible value for C = kH.

Case 1: H² = 144 => H = 12.
144 * LCM(6, k) = 3024 => LCM(6, k) = 21. The LCM of 6 and any other number must be a multiple of 6 (and therefore even), but 21 is odd. So, this case is impossible.

Case 2: H² = 36 => H = 6.
36 * LCM(6, k) = 3024 => LCM(6, k) = 84. (84 = 2² * 3 * 7). For LCM(6, k) to be 84, k must provide the factors 2² and 7. The smallest such k is LCM(4, 7) = 28. Then C = kH = 28 * 6 = 168.

Case 3: H² = 9 => H = 3.
9 * LCM(6, k) = 3024 => LCM(6, k) = 336. (336 = 24 * 3 * 7). For LCM(6, k) to be 336, k must provide the factors 24 and 7. The smallest such k is LCM(16, 7) = 112. Then C = kH = 112 * 3 = 336.

Case 4: H² = 4 => H = 2.
4 * LCM(6, k) = 3024 => LCM(6, k) = 756. (756 = 2² * 3³ * 7). For LCM(6, k) to be 756, k must provide 2², 3³, and 7. Smallest k = LCM(4, 27, 7) = 756. Then C = kH = 756 * 2 = 1512.

Case 5: H² = 1 => H = 1.
1 * LCM(6, k) = 3024. (3024 = 24 * 3³ * 7). For LCM(6, k) to be 3024, k must provide 24, 3³, and 7. Smallest k = LCM(16, 27, 7) = 3024. Then C = kH = 3024 * 1 = 3024.

Comparing the possible values for C (168, 336, 1512, 3024), the smallest is 168. Therefore, option 1 is correct.

Option 2, 336, is a possible value for C but arises when H=3, and it is not the smallest possible value.
Option 3, 112, is the value of k for the case H=3, not the value of C (which is kH).

To solve the given equation, we need to find a common denominator for the terms on the left-hand side. The term 1/9! can be rewritten using the factorial property n! = n * (n-1)!. So, 9! = 9 * 8!.

The equation becomes 1/8! + 1/(9*8!) = x/10!. We can take 1/8! as a common factor on the left side: (1/8!) * (1 + 1/9) = x/10!. Simplifying the expression in the parenthesis gives (1/8!) * (10/9) = x/10!. This is equivalent to 10/(9*8!) = x/10!, which simplifies to 10/9! = x/10!.

To find x, we can rearrange the equation: x = 10 * (10!/9!). Since 10! = 10 * 9!, the fraction 10!/9! simplifies to 10. Therefore, x = 10 * 10, which equals 100.

Option 1 is incorrect. This value would be obtained if one incorrectly assumed the equation was 1/8! = x/10!, which would lead to x = 10!/8! = 10 * 9 = 90. This ignores the 1/9! term.

Option 2 is incorrect. This error likely arises from simplifying 10/9! = x/10! to x=10 by ignoring the different denominators, or by incorrectly solving for a simplified equation like x/10! = 1/9!, which gives x = 10!/9! = 10. This ignores the 1/8! term.

Option 3 is incorrect. This might result from an algebraic mistake after reaching 10/9! = x/10!.

The core of this problem is to simplify the general term of the summation, k / (k+1)!. We can rewrite the numerator k as (k+1) - 1. This allows us to split the fraction. The term becomes ((k+1) - 1) / (k+1)! which is equal to (k+1)/(k+1)! - 1/(k+1)!. Using the property that (k+1)! = (k+1) * k!, the first part simplifies to 1/k!. So, the general term simplifies to 1/k! - 1/(k+1)!.

Now, the summation becomes a telescoping series: F(n) = sum from k=1 to n of [1/k! - 1/(k+1)!]. Let's write out the first few and the last terms: F(n) = (1/1! - 1/2!) + (1/2! - 1/3!) + (1/3! - 1/4!) + ... + (1/n! - 1/(n+1)!). The -1/2! from the first term cancels with the 1/2! from the second term, and this pattern continues. All intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the very first term (1/1!) and the very last term (-1/(n+1)!).

Therefore, the sum simplifies to F(n) = 1/1! - 1/(n+1)! = 1 - 1/(n+1)!. For n=14, this gives F(14) = 1 - 1/(14+1)! = 1 - 1/15!. To write this as a single fraction, we get (15!/15!) - (1/15!) = (15! - 1) / 15!.

Option 2, (14! - 1) / 14!, is incorrect. This would be the result if the sum simplified to 1 - 1/n!, which is a common off-by-one error in evaluating the telescoping series. Option 3, 14 / 15!, is incorrect and results from naively evaluating only the last term of the sum for k=14. Option 4, 1, is incorrect. This would be the value if the last term -1/(n+1)! was mistakenly ignored or cancelled, or by confusing the finite sum with its limit as n approaches infinity.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Factorial_1766391420007.png?

First, let's find the number of students in the Science stream. According to the pie chart, Science students constitute 20% of the total.
Total Science students = 20% of 12,000 = 0.20 * 12,000 = 2,400.
The question states that 50% of Science students are female, which means the remaining 50% must be male.
Male students in Science = 50% of 2,400 = 0.50 * 2,400 = 1,200.

Next, let's find the number of students in the Medical stream. The pie chart shows this is 10% of the total.
Total Medical students = 10% of 12,000 = 0.10 * 12,000 = 1,200.
The number of female students (F) is 25% of the number of male students (M), so F = 0.25 * M.
The total number of students in the stream is the sum of males and females: M + F = 1,200.
Substituting F, we get: M + (0.25 * M) = 1,200, which simplifies to 1.25 * M = 1,200.
Solving for M: M = 1,200 / 1.25 = 960. So, there are 960 male students in the Medical stream.

The second condition states that the number of employees in Department C increased by 420. From the pie charts, the percentage of employees in Department C is 15% in Year 1 and 25% in Year 2. This gives us our second equation:
(25% of T2) - (15% of T1) = 420
0.25 * T2 - 0.15 * T1 = 420.

Now, we solve this system of two equations. Substitute T2 = 1.2 * T1 into the second equation:
0.25 * (1.2 * T1) - 0.15 * T1 = 420
0.30 * T1 - 0.15 * T1 = 420

T2 = 1.2 * T1 = 1.2 * 2800 = 3360.

The question asks for the difference between the number of employees in Department D in Year 1 and Department A in Year 2.
Number of employees in Department D in Year 1 = 30% of T1 = 0.30 * 2800 = 840.
Number of employees in Department A in Year 2 = 20% of T2 = 0.20 * 3360 = 672.

The required difference is 840 - 672 = 168.

Option 2 (252) is incorrect. It arises if one misinterprets the condition as comparing the number of employees in Department C in Year 2 with Department B in Year 1, leading to T1=4200 and T2=5040.

Option 3 (420) is incorrect. This value is obtained if one incorrectly assumes the total number of employees is the same in both years (T1=T2). In that case, (0.25T - 0.15T) = 420, so 0.1T = 420 and T=4200. The requested difference would then be (0.30*4200) - (0.20*4200) = 0.10 * 4200 = 420.

Option 4 (960) is incorrect. This results from incorrectly reversing the percentage increase relationship, assuming T1 = 1.2 * T2. This would lead to T2=6000 and T1=7200, and a final difference of 960.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Pie_Chart_1766391840694.png?

First, calculate the total production of Model A from 2016 to 2018. From the graph, the production values for Model A are: 40 (in 2016), 35 (in 2017), and 50 (in 2018). The sum is 40 + 35 + 50 = 125 thousand units.

Next, calculate the total production of Model B from 2017 to 2019. From the graph, the production values for Model B are: 45 (in 2017), 40 (in 2018), and 55 (in 2019). The sum is 45 + 40 + 55 = 140 thousand units.

Finally, find the difference between the two totals: 140 - 125 = 15 thousand units. Therefore, the correct answer is 15.

Option 2 (5) is incorrect. This result might be obtained by misreading the production of Model A in 2017 as 45 instead of 35, which would lead to a total of 135 for Model A and a difference of |135 - 140| = 5.

Option 3 (10) is incorrect. This could be the result of misreading the production of Model B in 2019 as 50 instead of 55. This would make the total for Model B equal to 45 + 40 + 50 = 135, and the difference would be |125 - 135| = 10.

Option 4 (265) is incorrect. This value is the sum of the two totals (125 + 140 = 265), not the difference.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Line_Graph_1766391996658.png?

From the histogram, the frequency for the '20-30' score range is 18.
The frequency for the '30-40' score range is 25.
The frequency for the '40-50' score range is 15.

All students scoring 60 or more qualified. It is also known that a total of 250 students qualified for the next round. The additional qualifiers, who scored less than 60, were selected via a special quota. Among the students who qualified via this quota, the number of students from the 40-60 score range was three times the number from the 20-40 score range. No student scoring below 20 qualified. Based on this information, what is the ratio of the number of non-qualified students in the 40-60 score range to the number of non-qualified students in the 20-40 score range?",Histogram_1766392265356.png,"{""1"":""4:3"",""2"":""3:4"",""3"":""3:2"",""4"":""2:1""}",1.0,"The correct option is 1.

First, we determine the number of students who qualified based on their score alone (i.e., scoring 60 or more). From the histogram, the number of students in the 60-80 range is 130, and in the 80-100 range is 80. So, 130 + 80 = 210 students qualified with a score of 60 or more.

Next, we find the number of students who qualified via the special quota. The total number of qualified students is 250. Therefore, the number of students who qualified via quota (with a score less than 60) is 250 - 210 = 40 students.

These 40 quota students are from the 20-40 and 40-60 score ranges. Let the number of quota students from the 20-40 range be 'x'. Then the number of quota students from the 40-60 range is '3x'. The total number of quota students is x + 3x = 40. This gives 4x = 40, so x = 10. Thus, 10 quota students are from the 20-40 range, and 3*10 = 30 quota students are from the 40-60 range.

Now, we find the number of non-qualified students in these ranges. The total number of students in the 20-40 range is 100. Since 10 of them qualified, the number of non-qualified students is 100 - 10 = 90. The total number of students in the 40-60 range is 150. Since 30 of them qualified, the number of non-qualified students is 150 - 30 = 120.

Finally, we calculate the required ratio of non-qualified students in the 40-60 range to those in the 20-40 range. The ratio is 120 : 90, which simplifies to 12 : 9, and further to 4 : 3.

Option 2 is incorrect because it is the inverted ratio (90:120 = 3:4). Option 3 is incorrect as it represents the ratio of the total number of students in the respective ranges (150:100 = 3:2), ignoring the qualification criteria. Option 4 results from incorrectly distributing the quota students, for instance, by calculating x = 30 and 3x = 10, leading to non-qualified counts of 70 (100-30) and 140 (150-10), and a ratio of 140:70 or 2:1.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Histogram_1766392265356.png?

The solution requires a multi-step calculation based on the conditions provided.

Step 1: Identify departments eligible for the incentive plan. Eligibility requires the number of projects per employee to be at least 2.2.
- IT: 150 projects / 60 employees = 2.5 (Eligible)
- HR: 45 projects / 25 employees = 1.8 (Not Eligible)
- Marketing: 90 projects / 40 employees = 2.25 (Eligible)
- Finance: 75 projects / 30 employees = 2.5 (Eligible)
- Operations: 210 projects / 75 employees = 2.8 (Eligible)

Step 2: Calculate the base incentive for each eligible department ($500 per employee).
- IT: 60 employees * $500 = $30,000
- Marketing: 40 employees * $500 = $20,000
- Finance: 30 employees * $500 = $15,000
- Operations: 75 employees * $500 = $37,500

Step 3: Check for and calculate the 'Efficiency Bonus' for eligible departments. The bonus applies if the Average Project Completion Time is less than 30 days.
- IT: Avg. Time is 28 days (< 30). Bonus = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000.
- Marketing: Avg. Time is 35 days (not < 30). Bonus = $0.
- Finance: Avg. Time is 42 days (not < 30). Bonus = $0.
- Operations: Avg. Time is 25 days (< 30). Bonus = 20% of $37,500 = $7,500.

Step 4: Calculate the total incentive for each department and sum them up.
- IT Total: $30,000 (base) + $6,000 (bonus) = $36,000
- Marketing Total: $20,000 (base) + $0 (bonus) = $20,000
- Finance Total: $15,000 (base) + $0 (bonus) = $15,000
- Operations Total: $37,500 (base) + $7,500 (bonus) = $45,000
- Total Disbursed Amount: $36,000 + $20,000 + $15,000 + $45,000 = $116,000.

Option 2 is incorrect because it is the sum of the base incentives for eligible departments ($102,500) without adding the Efficiency Bonus.

**Step 1: Complete the 2022 Data**
1.  From the table for Physics: Total funding is 50, GG is 20. So, CS funding = 50 - 20 = 30 million.
2.  From the table for Biology: All values are given. Total funding is 30 million.
3.  From the text, total funding for Chemistry = 1.5 * total funding for Biology = 1.5 * 30 = 45 million. From the table, Chemistry's CS funding is 25 million. Therefore, Chemistry's GG funding = 45 - 25 = 20 million.
4.  Now, calculate the 2022 totals: Total GG = 20 (Physics) + 20 (Chem) + 15 (Bio) = 55 million. Total CS = 30 (Physics) + 25 (Chem) + 15 (Bio) = 70 million. Total Funding = 55 + 70 = 125 million.
5.  Verify with the text: Total GG (55) should be 11/14th of Total CS (70). (11/14) * 70 = 55. This is consistent.

**Step 2: Complete the 2023 Data**
1.  From the text, total funding for the Physics division in 2023 = Total funding in 2022 - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40 million.
2.  From the table, Physics CS funding for 2023 is 35 million. Therefore, Physics GG funding = 40 - 35 = 5 million.
3.  From the text, for Chemistry, CS funding = GG funding - 5. Also, from the table, Chem GG + Chem CS = 65. Substituting the first equation into the second: Chem GG + (Chem GG - 5) = 65 => 2 * Chem GG = 70 => Chem GG = 35 million. Thus, Chem CS = 35 - 5 = 30 million.
4.  From the text, Total GG funding for 2023 is 70 million. We can find Biology's GG funding by subtraction: Bio GG = Total GG - Physics GG - Chem GG = 70 - 5 - 35 = 30 million. (This matches the table where Bio Total is 50 and Bio CS is 20, so Bio GG = 30).

**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Increase**
1.  From Step 1, funding from CS for the Physics division in 2022 was 30 million.
2.  From Step 2 (or the table), funding from CS for the Physics division in 2023 is 35 million.
3.  Increase = 35 - 30 = 5 million.
4.  Percentage Increase = (Increase / Initial Value) * 100 = (5 / 30) * 100 = (1/6) * 100 = 16.67%.

Thus, the approximate percentage increase is 16.7%.

Option 2 is incorrect. -20% represents the percentage decrease in the *total* funding for the Physics division ((40-50)/50).
Option 3 is incorrect. 24% is the percentage increase in the institute's *total* funding ((155-125)/125).
Option 4 is incorrect. 14.3% results from an error in the percentage calculation, using the final value as the base instead of the initial value ((5/35)*100).",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Caselets_1766420580446.png?

To determine the value of 'y', we must analyze each statement's sufficiency. Let's evaluate Statement (2) first. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. An even number is an integer divisible by 2. The only number that is both even and prime is 2. Therefore, Statement (2) uniquely determines that y = 2. This statement alone is sufficient.

39.0,Data Sufficiency,Two Statements – Single Variable,hard,"If `x` is an integer and `k` is a positive integer, what is the value of `x`? Refer to the equation shown.

Statement I: `k` is a prime number.

First, let's analyze the equation provided in the question stem. The equation is a cubic polynomial in `x`. We can factor it by grouping:
`x^3 + x^2 - kx - k = 0`
`x^2(x + 1) - k(x + 1) = 0`
`(x^2 - k)(x + 1) = 0`
This gives two possibilities for the value of `x`: `x + 1 = 0` or `x^2 - k = 0`. So, `x = -1` or `x^2 = k`. Since the question states that `x` is an integer, the solutions depend on the value of `k`. If `k` is a perfect square (e.g., k = m^2 for some integer m), then `x^2 = k` yields integer solutions `x = m` and `x = -m`. In this case, the possible integer values for `x` are `-1`, `m`, and `-m`. If `k` is not a perfect square, `x^2 = k` has no integer solutions, so the only possible integer value for `x` is `-1`.

Now let's evaluate Statement (I): `k` is a prime number. The prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. A prime number has only two distinct factors: 1 and itself. A perfect square `m^2` (for m > 1) has at least three factors: 1, `m`, and `m^2`. The only perfect square that is not in this category is `1^2=1`, which is not a prime number. Therefore, no prime number is a perfect square. This means `k` cannot be a perfect square. Consequently, the equation `x^2 = k` has no integer solutions for `x`. The only possible integer solution for `x` from the original equation is `x = -1`. This gives a single, unique value for `x`. Thus, Statement (I) alone is sufficient.

Next, let's evaluate Statement (II): `k < 4`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the possible values for `k` are 1, 2, and 3. We must check if this information leads to a unique value for `x`.
Case 1: `k = 1`. The number 1 is a perfect square (1^2). The possible solutions for `x` are `x = -1` and the solutions to `x^2 = 1`, which are `x = 1` and `x = -1`. So, if `k=1`, `x` could be -1 or 1. This is not a unique value.
Case 2: `k = 2`. The number 2 is not a perfect square. The only integer solution is `x = -1`.
Case 3: `k = 3`. The number 3 is not a perfect square. The only integer solution is `x = -1`.
Since `k` could be 1, we cannot be certain that `x = -1`. The value of `x` could be 1. Because there is no single unique value for `x` that satisfies the condition for all possible values of `k`, Statement (II) alone is not sufficient.

Since Statement (I) alone is sufficient and Statement (II) alone is not sufficient, the correct option is 1. Option 2 is incorrect because Statement (II) is not sufficient. Option 3 is incorrect because Statement (I) is sufficient by itself. Option 4 is incorrect because the question can be answered using Statement (I).",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Two_Statements_-_Single_Variable_1766420759676.png?

Statement (1) provides the equation a² - b² = 24. This can be factored using the difference of squares formula into (a - b)(a + b) = 24. To find the value of 'a - b' from this equation, we would need the value of 'a + b'. Since 'a + b' is unknown, we cannot find a unique value for 'a - b'. For example, if a + b = 12, then a - b = 2. If a + b = 8, then a - b = 3. Therefore, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.

Statement (2) states that a + b = 6. This statement gives the sum of a and b, but provides no information about their difference. There are infinite pairs of 'a' and 'b' that sum to 6 (e.g., a=4, b=2 gives a-b=2; a=5, b=1 gives a-b=4). Therefore, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.

To determine the value of x/y, we must evaluate each statement's sufficiency.

Statement (1) provides an equation. We can simplify it algebraically:
(x^2 + 4y^2) / (4xy) = 1
Multiply both sides by 4xy (which is non-zero since x and y are non-zero):
x^2 + 4y^2 = 4xy
Rearrange the terms to one side:
x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 0
This is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:
(x - 2y)^2 = 0
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
x - 2y = 0
x = 2y
Since y is non-zero, we can divide by y to find the value of the ratio x/y:
x/y = 2
Thus, Statement (1) alone is sufficient to determine a unique value for x/y.

Statement (2) provides the equation 3x = 6y. We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 3:
x = 2y
Again, since y is non-zero, we can divide by y:
x/y = 2
Thus, Statement (2) alone is also sufficient to determine a unique value for x/y.

Analyzing statement (1) alone: It states that x is a prime number between 10 and 15. The prime numbers in this range are 11 and 13. Since x could be either of two values, we cannot determine a unique value for x. Thus, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.

First, let's find the possible integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation. Since x and y must be positive integers, we can test values for x and see if we get an integer value for y. The equation can be rearranged to 3y = 47 - 5x. This means that 47 - 5x must be a positive multiple of 3.
- If x = 1, 3y = 47 - 5 = 42, so y = 14. This is a valid pair (1, 14).
- If x = 2, 3y = 47 - 10 = 37. Not a multiple of 3.
- If x = 3, 3y = 47 - 15 = 32. Not a multiple of 3.
- If x = 4, 3y = 47 - 20 = 27, so y = 9. This is a valid pair (4, 9).
- If x = 5, 3y = 47 - 25 = 22. Not a multiple of 3.
- If x = 6, 3y = 47 - 30 = 17. Not a multiple of 3.
- If x = 7, 3y = 47 - 35 = 12, so y = 4. This is a valid pair (7, 4).
- If x = 8, 3y = 47 - 40 = 7. Not a multiple of 3.
- If x is 9 or greater, 5x is 45 or greater, making 47 - 5x too small to yield a positive y.
So, the possible pairs (x, y) are (1, 14), (4, 9), and (7, 4). The possible values for x are 1, 4, or 7.

Statement (1): y < 10.
This condition is met by the pairs (4, 9) and (7, 4), as in both cases y is less than 10. It eliminates the pair (1, 14). This leaves two possible values for x: 4 and 7. Since we cannot determine a unique value for x, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.

Statement (2): x > 5.
This condition is only met by the pair (7, 4), since x=7 is the only value of x greater than 5. The other possible values for x (1 and 4) are eliminated. This gives a unique value for x, which is 7. Therefore, statement (2) alone is sufficient.

Let's analyze Statement (1). Let the first integer in the sequence be 'k', where k is a positive integer (k = 1). The sum of 'n' consecutive integers is given by the arithmetic progression formula: Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term). The last term is k + n - 1. So, 105 = (n/2) * (k + k + n - 1), which simplifies to 210 = n * (2k + n - 1). Since k = 1, we have 2k = 2, which means (2k + n - 1) = (2 + n - 1) = n + 1. So, 'n' and '(2k + n - 1)' are two factors of 210, where 'n' is the smaller factor. The factors of 210 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210. We can find multiple pairs that work. For example, if n = 6, then 2k + 5 = 35, so 2k = 30 and k = 15. This is a valid sequence. If n = 7, then 2k + 6 = 30, so 2k = 24 and k = 12. This is also a valid sequence. Since 'n' can be 6, 7, or other values, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.

Now, let's analyze Statement (2). The product of the integers is a multiple of 819. First, we find the prime factorization of 819: 819 = 9 * 91 = 3^2 * 7 * 13. This means the set of 'n' consecutive integers must contain factors that multiply to 819. Specifically, the product must be divisible by 9, 7, and 13. We can construct sets of consecutive integers of different lengths that satisfy this. For example, the set {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13} has n=7; its product is divisible by 7, 9, and 13. Another example is the set {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}, where n=8; its product is also divisible by 7, 9, and 13. Since 'n' is not unique, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.

Finally, let's combine both statements. From statement (1), we found a set of possible values for 'n', which includes {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14}. We must check which of these cases also satisfy statement (2). 
Case n=7: From (1), k=12. The set is {12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}. This set contains 13, 14 (a multiple of 7), and 18 (a multiple of 9). The product is a multiple of 819. So, n=7 is a possible answer.
Case n=10: From (1), k=6. The set is {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}. This set contains 7, 9, and 13. The product is a multiple of 819. So, n=10 is a possible answer.
Case n=14: From (1), k=1. The set is {1, 2, ..., 14}. This set contains 7, 9, and 13. The product is a multiple of 819. So, n=14 is a possible answer.
Since we have found at least three possible values for 'n' (7, 10, and 14) that satisfy both statements, we cannot determine a unique value for 'n'. Thus, the statements together are not sufficient.

It is a symmetric polynomial in a, b, and c. We can express E in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials: S1 = a+b+c, S2 = ab+bc+ca, and S3 = abc.
The identity is E = (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = (S1-a)(S1-b)(S1-c) = S1^3 - (a+b+c)S1^2 + (ab+bc+ca)S1 - abc = S1*S2 - S3.
So, to find the value of E, we need to find the values of S1, S2, and S3.

Statement (1) provides S1 = a+b+c = 10 and S2 = ab+bc+ca = 31. Using these, E = 10 * 31 - abc = 310 - abc. Since the value of abc is not known, statement (1) alone is not sufficient. We can show that multiple sets of positive real numbers satisfy these two equations with different products 'abc', leading to different values for E.

Statement (2) provides a^3+b^3+c^3 = 160. This single equation with three variables has infinitely many solutions for a, b, and c (for example, a = (160)^(1/3), b and c approaching 0). Therefore, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together. We have S1=10, S2=31, and a^3+b^3+c^3=160. We use the identity: a^3+b^3+c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2 - ab-bc-ca). First, we find a^2+b^2+c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+bc+ca) = S1^2 - 2*S2 = 10^2 - 2*31 = 100 - 62 = 38. Now, we substitute the known values into the identity: 160 - 3(abc) = (10)(38 - 31) = 10 * 7 = 70. This gives 3(abc) = 160 - 70 = 90, which means abc = 30. We have found a unique value for S3 = abc. Now we can calculate E = 310 - abc = 310 - 30 = 280. It's worth noting that the numbers a,b,c are the roots of the cubic t^3 - 10t^2 + 31t - 30 = 0, which are {2, 3, 5}, all positive real numbers, so the premises are consistent. Since we found a unique value for E, both statements together are sufficient.

First, consider Statement (1) alone. It states that p > q > r. However, it gives no information about the value of s relative to the other three numbers. The number s could be the largest, second largest, third largest, or smallest. For example, if we have the order p > q > s > r, then q is the second largest. But if we have the order s > p > q > r, then p is the second largest. Since we cannot arrive at a definite 'yes' or 'no' answer, Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.

Next, consider Statement (2) alone. It states that s > p. This provides a relationship between s and p but tells us nothing about the positions of q and r. For example, we could have the order s > q > p > r, which would make q the second largest. Alternatively, we could have s > p > q > r, which would make p the second largest. As there are multiple possibilities, Statement (2) alone is not sufficient.

Now, consider both statements together. From Statement (1), we have p > q > r. From Statement (2), we have s > p. By combining these two inequalities, we can establish a single, definitive order for all four numbers: s > p > q > r. In this order, s is the largest number, p is the second largest, q is the third largest, and r is the smallest.

Let's analyze Statement 1. The equation given is p² = q² + 2q + 1. The right side of the equation is a perfect square, (q+1)². So, the statement is equivalent to p² = (q+1)². Taking the square root of both sides, we get two possibilities: p = q+1 or p = -(q+1). Case A: If p = q+1, then p is clearly greater than q. The answer to the question 'Is p > q?' would be 'Yes'. Case B: If p = -(q+1) = -q-1. We can't determine if p > q. For example, if q = 1 (a non-zero integer), then p = -1-1 = -2. Here, p < q. The answer is 'No'. If q = -2 (a non-zero integer), then p = -(-2)-1 = 1. Here, p > q. The answer is 'Yes'. Since we can get both 'Yes' and 'No' from Statement 1, it is not sufficient.

Now, let's analyze Statement 2. The statement is p + q > 0. This statement alone is not sufficient. For example, if p = 5 and q = 1, then p+q = 6 > 0 and p > q. The answer is 'Yes'. However, if p = 1 and q = 5, then p+q = 6 > 0 but p < q. The answer is 'No'. Thus, Statement 2 is not sufficient.

Now, let's combine both statements. From Statement 1, we have two cases: p = q+1 or p = -q-1. We must check these cases against Statement 2 (p + q > 0). In Case A (p = q+1), substituting p into the inequality from Statement 2 gives (q+1) + q > 0, which simplifies to 2q + 1 > 0, or q > -0.5. Since q is a non-zero integer, q must be a positive integer (q = 1). In this scenario, p = q+1 is always greater than q. This case consistently gives a 'Yes' answer. In Case B (p = -q-1), substituting p into the inequality from Statement 2 gives (-q-1) + q > 0, which simplifies to -1 > 0. This is a contradiction and is impossible. Therefore, Case B cannot occur when both statements are true. The only possibility when both statements are considered together is that p = q+1, which definitively means p > q. So, together the statements are sufficient.

Since neither statement is sufficient on its own, but they are sufficient when combined, the correct option is 3. Option 1 is incorrect because Statement 1 is not sufficient alone. Option 2 is incorrect because Statement 2 is not sufficient alone.

To find the range of E = 2y - 4x, we first need to find the ranges for the terms 2y and -4x individually and then add them.

First, let's find the range for the term '-4x'. We are given -3 < x = 5. To get -4x, we multiply the inequality by -4. When multiplying an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the inequality signs. So, (-3) * (-4) > -4x = 5 * (-4), which simplifies to 12 > -4x = -20. Writing this in the standard 'less than' format gives -20 = -4x < 12.

Next, let's find the range for the term '2y'. We are given -6 = y < -2. Multiplying by 2 (a positive number) does not change the inequality signs. So, (-6) * 2 = 2y < (-2) * 2, which simplifies to -12 = 2y < -4.

Finally, we add the two resulting inequalities to find the range of E = 2y - 4x. We add the lower bounds together and the upper bounds together: (-20) + (-12) = -4x + 2y < 12 + (-4). This simplifies to -32 = 2y - 4x < 8, which means -32 = E < 8.

Option 2 is incorrect because it confuses the strict (<) and non-strict (=) bounds. The value E = -32 is attainable when y = -6 and x = 5 (both are allowed), so the lower bound must be inclusive (=). The value E = 8 would require y = -2 and x = -3 (neither of which are allowed by the original inequalities), so the upper bound must be exclusive (<).

Option 3 is incorrect. It represents the range for the expression 2y + 4x. The range for 4x is -12 < 4x = 20. Adding this to the range for 2y gives -24 < 2y + 4x < 16.

Option 4 is incorrect and likely arises from an invalid method of calculation, such as subtracting the endpoints of the ranges for 2y and 4x, which is not a valid operation.",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Basic_Inequalities_1766423361558.png?

The solution requires finding the range for x, y, and z, and then using those to find the range of the expression E = x^2 - yz.

First, we determine the interval for each variable:
For x: The inequality is |x - 3| = 2. This is equivalent to -2 = x - 3 = 2. Adding 3 to all parts gives 1 = x = 5.
For y: The inequality is |2y - 7| = 5. This is equivalent to -5 = 2y - 7 = 5. Adding 7 to all parts gives 2 = 2y = 12. Dividing by 2 gives 1 = y = 6.
For z: The inequality is -4 = z + 1 < 3. Subtracting 1 from all parts gives -5 = z < 2.

Next, we find the range for the terms in the expression E = x^2 - yz.
For x^2: Since 1 = x = 5, and x is in a positive interval, we can square the endpoints to get the range for x^2, which is 1^2 = x^2 = 5^2, so 1 = x^2 = 25.

For yz: This is the trickiest part. We have 1 = y = 6 and -5 = z < 2. To find the range of the product, we check the products of the endpoints: 1*(-5) = -5, 1*2 = 2, 6*(-5) = -30, 6*2 = 12. The minimum of these is -30, and the maximum is 12. The minimum value, -30, is achieved when y=6 and z=-5. The maximum value, 12, would be achieved if y=6 and z=2, but z cannot be 2 (z < 2). Thus, yz is strictly less than 12. The range for yz is [-30, 12).

Now, we find the range for E = x^2 - yz. This is equivalent to finding the range of x^2 + (-yz).
The range for -yz is obtained by multiplying the interval [-30, 12) by -1 and flipping the inequality signs and endpoints: -12 < -yz = 30.

To find the range of E, we add the corresponding bounds of x^2 and -yz:
Lower bound of E = (Lower bound of x^2) + (Lower bound of -yz) = 1 + (-12) = -11. Since -12 is not included in the range of -yz, -11 is not included in the range of E. So, E > -11.
Upper bound of E = (Upper bound of x^2) + (Upper bound of -yz) = 25 + 30 = 55. This value is attainable (e.g., when x=5, y=6, z=-5). So, E = 55.

Therefore, the set of all possible values for E is the interval (-11, 55]. This matches the given form (a, b], where a = -11 and b = 55. The question asks for the value of b - a, which is 55 - (-11) = 55 + 11 = 66.

Option 2 (36) is incorrect. This might result from incorrectly assuming z is non-negative (0 = z < 2), leading to a range for yz of [0, 12) and a final range for E of (-11, 25], giving a length of 36.
Option 3 (55) is incorrect. This is the maximum value of the expression, b, but not the length of the interval, b-a.
Option 4 (44) is incorrect. This might be a calculation error, such as 55 - 11 = 44, instead of 55 - (-11).",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Basic_Inequalities_1766423471891.png?

A critical rule in inequalities is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the direction of the inequality signs must be reversed.

First, we must solve each inequality for 'x' in terms of 'k'.

For the first inequality:
Multiply by the LCM of the denominators (2, 4, 3), which is 12.
6(x - k) + 3(3x - 1) < 4x
6x - 6k + 9x - 3 < 4x

8x + 10k > 6x - 3k + 6
2x > -13k + 6
x > (-13k + 6) / 2

Combining these two results, the solution set for 'x' is the open interval ((-13k + 6) / 2, (6k + 3) / 11).

For this solution interval to contain the entire closed interval [1, 2], two conditions must be met simultaneously:
The lower bound of the solution must be less than or equal to 1, AND the upper bound must be greater than or equal to 2.

Condition 1: (-13k + 6) / 2 = 1
-13k + 6 = 2
-13k = -4
13k = 4 (multiplying by -1 reverses the inequality sign)
k = 4/13

Condition 2: (6k + 3) / 11 = 2
6k + 3 = 22
6k = 19
k = 19/6

For the solution set to contain [1, 2], 'k' must satisfy both k = 4/13 and k = 19/6. To satisfy both, 'k' must be greater than or equal to the larger of the two values. Since 19/6 ˜ 3.17 and 4/13 ˜ 0.31, the stricter condition is k = 19/6.

Option 2 is incorrect because satisfying k = 4/13 only ensures the lower bound is correct; it does not guarantee the upper bound is high enough to include 2. For instance, if k = 1 (which is = 4/13), the solution interval for x is approximately (-3.5, 0.82), which does not contain [1, 2].

Option 3 is incorrect. This range would imply that k is bounded from above, which is not the case. It is a common mistake made by incorrectly combining the two conditions k = 4/13 and k = 19/6.

If k = 1, the inequality becomes 0*x^2 + 2(1 - 1)x + 2 > 0, which simplifies to 2 > 0. This is always true. Thus, k = 1 is part of the solution set.
If k = -1, the inequality becomes 0*x^2 + 2(-1 - 1)x + 2 > 0, which simplifies to -4x + 2 > 0, or x < 1/2. This is not true for all real values of x, so k = -1 is not a solution.

Case 2: The coefficient of x^2 is not zero.
For a quadratic expression Ax^2 + Bx + C to be always positive, two conditions must be met: the parabola must open upwards (A > 0) and it must not have real roots (Discriminant D < 0).

Condition (a): The coefficient of x^2 must be positive.
A = k^2 - 1 > 0 implies (k - 1)(k + 1) > 0. This inequality holds for k < -1 or k > 1. So, k ? (-8, -1) ? (1, 8).

Condition (b): The discriminant must be negative.
D = B^2 - 4AC < 0.
Here, A = k^2 - 1, B = 2(k - 1), C = 2.
D = (2(k - 1))^2 - 4(k^2 - 1)(2) = 4(k - 1)^2 - 8(k^2 - 1)
D = 4(k^2 - 2k + 1) - 8k^2 + 8 = 4k^2 - 8k + 4 - 8k^2 + 8 = -4k^2 - 8k + 12.
We need D < 0, so -4k^2 - 8k + 12 < 0. Dividing by -4 and reversing the inequality sign, we get k^2 + 2k - 3 > 0.
Factoring the quadratic, we get (k + 3)(k - 1) > 0. This inequality holds for k < -3 or k > 1. So, k ? (-8, -3) ? (1, 8).

For the quadratic case to hold, both conditions (a) and (b) must be satisfied. We find the intersection of their solution sets:
Intersection of {k ? (-8, -1) ? (1, 8)} and {k ? (-8, -3) ? (1, 8)} is k ? (-8, -3) ? (1, 8).

Finally, we combine the solutions from both Case 1 and Case 2. The total set of values for k is the union of the solution from the linear case {1} and the solution from the quadratic case (-8, -3) ? (1, 8). The union is k ? (-8, -3) ? [1, 8).

Option 1 is incorrect because it is the solution for the quadratic case only and omits the valid linear case where k = 1.
Option 3 is incorrect. It would be obtained by incorrectly solving the discriminant inequality k^2 + 2k - 3 > 0 as -3 < k < 1, and then intersecting this with k < -1 from the first condition, yielding (-3, -1).
Option 4 is incorrect because it represents the solution to only the first condition (A > 0) and ignores the discriminant condition (D < 0).",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Quadratic_Inequalities_1766423717817.png?

The first inequality is approximately -3.67 < x = 5. The integers that satisfy this condition are {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

The second inequality is -2 = x < 3.25. The integers that satisfy this condition are {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}.

The question asks for the integers that satisfy BOTH conditions. This means we need to find the intersection of the two sets of integers. The common integers are {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. Counting these integers, we find there are 6 such values. Therefore, 6 is the correct answer.

First, we need to find the solution set P by solving the two linear inequalities.

For the first inequality: `(3x - 7) / 4 < x - 5`. Multiplying by 4 gives `3x - 7 < 4x - 20`. Rearranging the terms, we get `13 < x`, or `x > 13`.

For the second inequality: `2(x + 1) >= 5x - 1`. Expanding the left side gives `2x + 2 >= 5x - 1`. Rearranging the terms, we get `3 >= 3x`, which simplifies to `1 >= x`, or `x <= 1`.

Since the compound inequality uses the word 'OR', Set P is the union of these two solutions. On a number line, Set P includes all numbers less than or equal to 1, and all numbers greater than 13. So, `P = (-8, 1] U (13, 8)`.

The question asks for integers `y` that are NOT in Set P. This corresponds to the complement of Set P on the number line, which is the interval between 1 and 13. Since P includes 1 (`x <= 1`) and excludes 13 (`x > 13`), the complement is `(1, 13]`.

Set Q consists of integers `y` that are in the interval `[-4, 10)` and also in the interval `(1, 13]`. We need to find the integers in the intersection of these two sets.

The total revenue is the selling price per widget multiplied by the number of widgets: R(x) = 90x.
The total cost is the sum of the fixed cost and the total variable cost: C(x) = 12000 + 40x.
The profit, P(x), is the difference between total revenue and total cost: P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 90x - (12000 + 40x) = 50x - 12000.

The problem states that the profit must be at least $8,000 but strictly less than $23,000. This can be written as the compound inequality:
8000 = P(x) < 23000
Substitute the expression for profit:
8000 = 50x - 12000 < 23000

To solve for x, first add 12,000 to all parts of the inequality:
8000 + 12000 = 50x < 23000 + 12000
20000 = 50x < 35000

Next, divide all parts by 50:
20000 / 50 = x < 35000 / 50
400 = x < 700

The inequality shows that the number of widgets, x, must be greater than or equal to 400 and strictly less than 700. The question asks for the maximum number of widgets. Since x must be an integer and less than 700, the maximum possible integer value for x is 699.

Option 1 (400) is incorrect because it represents the minimum number of widgets required, not the maximum.
Option 3 (700) is incorrect because the profit must be strictly less than $23,000, which means x must be strictly less than 700. Selling 700 widgets would result in a profit of exactly $23,000, which is not allowed.

To find the minimum value of `r`, we must analyze the given system of inequalities:
1) `3t + r <= 30`
2) `5t + 2r >= 40`
3) `t >= 4`
4) `2r >= 3t`

We need to find a feasible region for `r` by expressing `t` in terms of `r` from each inequality.
From (1): `3t <= 30 - r` => `t <= (30 - r) / 3`
From (2): `5t >= 40 - 2r` => `t >= (40 - 2r) / 5`
From (3): `t >= 4`
From (4): `t <= 2r / 3`

For a solution for `t` to exist, the lower bound for `t` must be less than or equal to the upper bound for `t`. The lower bound is the maximum of the two individual lower bounds, and the upper bound is the minimum of the two individual upper bounds.
So, `max(4, (40 - 2r) / 5) <= t <= min((30 - r) / 3, 2r / 3)`.

This implies that the maximum of the lower bounds must be less than or equal to the minimum of the upper bounds. This gives us four conditions to satisfy:
a) `4 <= (30 - r) / 3` => `12 <= 30 - r` => `r <= 18`
b) `4 <= 2r / 3` => `12 <= 2r` => `r >= 6`
c) `(40 - 2r) / 5 <= (30 - r) / 3` => `120 - 6r <= 150 - 5r` => `-30 <= r` (always true since `r` must be non-negative)
d) `(40 - 2r) / 5 <= 2r / 3` => `120 - 6r <= 10r` => `120 <= 16r` => `r >= 7.5`

Combining all conditions on `r`: we need `r >= 6`, `r >= 7.5`, and `r <= 18`. The most restrictive combination is `7.5 <= r <= 18`. Since `r` must be an integer, the minimum possible value for `r` is 8. To confirm, if `r = 8`, the inequality for `t` becomes `max(4, 4.8) <= t <= min(7.33, 5.33)`, which simplifies to `4.8 <= t <= 5.33`. The integer `t=5` satisfies this, so a solution exists for `r=8`.

Option 1 (6) is incorrect because `r=6` violates the condition `r >= 7.5`. If `r=6`, there is no integer `t` that satisfies all conditions.
Option 2 (7) is incorrect because `r=7` also violates the condition `r >= 7.5`. This is a common error if one rounds 7.5 down.

The given inequality is | |x - 3| - 5 | / |x - 2| > 1. First, we must note that the denominator cannot be zero, so x ? 2. We can multiply both sides by |x - 2| (since it is non-negative and not zero) to get | |x - 3| - 5 | > |x - 2|.

Since both sides of the inequality are non-negative, we can square both sides: ( |x - 3| - 5 )² > (x - 2)². Rearranging this gives ( |x - 3| - 5 )² - (x - 2)² > 0. Using the difference of squares formula a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b), we get:
( |x - 3| - 5 - (x - 2) ) * ( |x - 3| - 5 + (x - 2) ) > 0
( |x - 3| - x - 3 ) * ( |x - 3| + x - 7 ) > 0

We now solve this by considering two cases for |x - 3|:
Case 1: x = 3. In this case, |x - 3| = x - 3.
The inequality becomes: ( (x - 3) - x - 3 ) * ( (x - 3) + x - 7 ) > 0, which simplifies to (-6) * (2x - 10) > 0. Dividing by -6 and reversing the inequality sign gives 2x - 10 < 0, so 2x < 10, and x < 5. The solution for this case, intersecting x = 3 with x < 5, is [3, 5). The integers in this interval are 3 and 4.

Case 2: x < 3. In this case, |x - 3| = -(x - 3) = 3 - x.
The inequality becomes: ( (3 - x) - x - 3 ) * ( (3 - x) + x - 7 ) > 0, which simplifies to (-2x) * (-4) > 0. This gives 8x > 0, so x > 0. The solution for this case, intersecting x < 3 with x > 0, is (0, 3).

Combining the solutions from both cases, we get the interval [3, 5) U (0, 3). We must remember the initial condition that x ? 2. So the final solution set is (0, 2) U (2, 5). The integers in this set are 1, 3, and 4. The sum of these integers is 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.

Option 2, 10, is incorrect; it results from incorrectly including x = 2 in the solution set (1 + 2 + 3 + 4). Option 3, 7, is incorrect; it is the sum of integers from only Case 1 (3 + 4), ignoring the solutions from Case 2. Option 4, 3, is incorrect; it could be obtained by considering only Case 2 and incorrectly including x=2 (1+2).",https://cripzwtfxuxeyfpfvqrd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/questions/Inequalities_with_Modulus_1766424129569.png?
